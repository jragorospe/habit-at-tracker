# Habit-at Tracker

The Habit-at Tracker is a prototype made to play around with the idea of data physicalization and Processing 
communication to the Arduino.

### Development

This was a collaborative effort with Aidan Lee.
She developed the Processing App while I constructed the Arduino Code and created
the physical structure of the project. For more information on the project check the
